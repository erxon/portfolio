PROJECTS (Not related to my work experience):
- Gather: Gather is an information system that deals with missing person management. 
This system is intended for authorities such as Police and Baranggay officials. 
It uses Face Recognition and Maps. Imagga API was used in Face Recognition and Mapbox is used for mapping and routes.
I have created this system using React, Next.js, MongoDB, Mapbox, and Imagga API for face recognition.

- Wise Notes: Wise Notes is a web-based note application with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to learn from the user's notes. 
It uses LangChain, Groq, and Huggingface API. 
Users can generate new ideas and knowledges based on their notes. 
I have created this system using React, Next.js, MongoDB, LangChain, Groq, Huggingface API, and AWS App Runner ECS.
In this project I have learned about vector database, chunking, and converting texts into embeddings.
I have deployed the backend using AWS App Runner ECS. I containerize the backend first using Docker.
The application is live at: https://wise-notes-v2-8ppi.vercel.app/

- OpsAI: OpsAI is an end-to-end automation engine designed to eliminate manual data entry and back-office bottlenecks. 
Built with an agentic architecture, it doesn't just read data, it understands context, validates information against existing records, and executes workflows autonomously.
I have created this system using Next.js, Supabase, LangChain, Groq, and Huggingface API. 
I have deployed the backend using AWS App Runner ECS. I containerize the backend first using Docker.
The application is live at: https://opsai-gilt.vercel.app/

Other projects:
- Judelu Website: This is a website I built for a client. I used Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
The application is live at: https://judelu.vercel.app/

- Product Sourcing Agent: This is an Agentic system that helps me find great deals online without manually browsing websites and comparing prices.
I have created this system using Python as my main language, CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration, and Streamlit for the UI.
